This is the main repository for my portfolio website.

My portfolio is a dynamic site built with React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. It features a modular design that allows for smooth scalability and future enhancements, with a strong emphasis on responsive layouts and clean user interactions. The site showcases a variety of projects, each with dedicated pages designed to highlight their unique features and contributions, ensuring a seamless and intuitive browsing experience.
The design is inspired by clarity and functionality, incorporating animation with Framer Motion to bring a sense of depth and engagement to the user interface. This portfolio was built to explore the integration of lovely design with modern web development practices, blending performance optimization with aesthetic appeal. It is currently live and actively maintained as a central hub for my work.
